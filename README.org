#+TITLE: Project structure test

A ~shared_object~ linking mode was recently added to [[https://github.com/ocaml/dune][dune]]. I tried to take
advantage of it to simplify a project of mine without success.

Quite often, I'm sharing my =OCaml= work as standard shared objects (aka =.so= or
=.dll=).

I'm creating the current project, in order to understand how to set things (and
get help on a concrete project).

* lib

A two functions pure =OCaml= lib.
